The main orebody, hosted in a major interbedding fracture zone (F2) between sandstones and carbonaceous slates, measures 750×350×8.15 m with an average grade of 2.04% Cu (Wang and Lu 1991). The orebodies consist of sulfide-bearing quartz–ankerite veins and altered wall rocks, with ore minerals occurring in both veins and wall rocks. The alteration in the wall rocks is mainly silicification, carbonatization, graphitization, and sericitization.
